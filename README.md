# AngularJS Workshop

## Prereqs
1. A computer
2. A text editor
3. A web browser (I'll be using Chrome)
4. Basic understanding of JavaScript (Objects, truthy/falsy, functions, etc)
5. AngularJS "Hello World"

## Things I WON'T cover
* Grunt/Gulp build processes
* Deployment
* Server and/or server optimizations
* JavaScript/HTML/CSS intro
* Start to finish process of an Angular App

We'll be using a generated project layout with a few changes to run the project but this is intended to be focused on the code.

## Agenda
* AngularJS 10,000 foot overview
  * Databinding
  * Directives
  * Dependency Injection
* Sample project overview (from github)
  * "Legacy code"
  * Pain points
* Refactor
  * Directives - use them
  * Bind once
  * Link vs compile
  * Error handling
* Reorganize
  * Use AngularJS modules correctly
* Benchmarks
  * FPS
  * Chrome JS Profiler

## 10,000 Foot Overview
### Databinding

* Common issues throughout
* Legacy version of Angular

## Refactor
### Directives
* Two directives currently used TODO
